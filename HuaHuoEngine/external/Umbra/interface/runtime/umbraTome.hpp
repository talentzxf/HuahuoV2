/*!
 * \brief   The data container for visibility and spatial connectivity data.
 *
 * See \ref umbradata for a description of the Tome data format.
 *
 * The output of the Umbra Optimizer computation is a Tome object for the
 * input scene. To make use of Umbra Runtime queries the Tome data corresponding
 * to the scene must be loaded by the runtime system and introduced to a
 * Query context via Query::init().
 *
 * The Tome object wraps a read-only data buffer of size Tome::getSize().
 * There is no serialization or deserialization needed for the data, the Tome
 * can simply be stored by storing the data array starting at the memory pointed
 * to by the Tome pointer. The data buffer is internally accessed as an array of
 * 32-bit elements. When the endianness of the runtime environment differs from
 * the endianness of the computation platform, an endianness swap needs to be
 * performed for the data array. Tome::swapEndianness() is provided for this
 * purpose. Additionally, the data start must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary.
 * Tome::getStatus() can be used to confirm that these requirements are met.
 *
 * The TomeLoader utility is provided for convenient loading of the Tome data.
 *
 * The Umbra runtime also supports queries involving multiple Tome data sets.
 * This is accomplished via the TomeCollection object that manages references
 * to the active Tome instances.
