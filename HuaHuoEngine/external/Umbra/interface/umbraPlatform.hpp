 * \brief       Allocator interface for dynamic memory allocations
 *
 * The Umbra classes that require dynamic allocations do so by callbacks
 * to the user provided Allocator implementation. This is to give the user
 * full control of the memory management. When no user implementation is
 * provided, a default implementation that uses std::malloc and std::free
 * is used.
 *
 * \note    The Umbra::Task implementation does not use the Allocator
 *          interface but uses the OS services directly instead.

     * contiguous block of memory of size indicated by the size parameter.
     * The semantics are similar to std::malloc. Note that Umbra does internal
     * memory management on top of the allocations through this interface to
     * reduce the number of calls.
     *
     * Umbra makes no effort of mutually excluding calls to the allocation
     * interface, whether or not the implementations should do this depends
     * on the usage pattern of the Umbra public interfaces: if calls are made
     * to the Umbra modules simulatenously from multiple threads then thread
     * safety needs to be implemented on this level as well.
