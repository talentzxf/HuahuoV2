     * computeTile() calls in a different Builder context, even on a different process or host.

     * data between computation nodes.
     *
     * This call is synchronous, there is no way to abort the tile computation or query its status
     * while the call is executing.
     *
     * Tile computation is a relatively heavyweight operation and computing the complete set of tiles
     * for a large scene can take up to hours. To be able to get results for particular areas of interest
     * it is possible to create Tomes containing partially finished results. If this is desired, create
